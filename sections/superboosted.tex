\begin{itemize}
\item What observables do we know have problems as a function of pT?
\item What observables are roughly scale independent?
\item What studies have already been done and what performance assessments can be made?
\item What lessons have been learned about detector requirements?
\item What studies are still missing and how can detector simulation be used or incorporated?
\end{itemize}
